          {'\n'}The early 20th century was a time of optimism in Britain. The
          nation, with its expansive Empire, well-admired navy, thriving
          industry and strong political institutions, was what is now known as a
          global 'superpower'. It was also a time of social progress.
          Financial help for the unemployed, old-age pensions and free school
          meals were just a few of the important measures introduced. Various
          laws were passed to improve safety in the workplace; town planning
          rules were tightened to prevent the further development of slums; and
          better support was given to mothers and their children after divorce
          or separation. Local government became more democratic and a salary
          for members of Parliament (MPs) was introduced for the first time,
          making it easier for more people to take part in public life.

          {'\n'}
          This era of optimism and progress was cut short when war broke out
          between several European nations. On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz
          Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. This set off a chain of events
          leading to the First World War (1914 - 18). But while the
          assassination provided the trigger for war, other factors, such as
          a growing sense of nationalism in many European states; increasing
          militarism; imperialism; and the division of the major European powers
          into two camps, all set the conditions for war.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          The conflict was centred in Europe, but it was a global war involving
          nations from around the world. Britain was part of the Allied Powers,
          which included (amongst others) France, Russia, Japan, Belgium, Serbia
         , and later, Greece, Italy, Romania and the United States. The whole
          of the British Empire was involved in the conflict, for example,
          more than a million Indians fought on behalf of Britain in lots of
          different countries, and around 40,000 were killed. Men from the West
          Indies, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also fought with the
          British. The Allies fought against the Central Powers, mainly
          Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and later
          Bulgaria. Millions of people were killed or wounded, with more than 2
          million British casualties. One battle, the British attack on the
          Somme in July 1916, resulted in about 60,000 British casualties on the
          first day alone.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          The First World War ended at 11.00 am on 11th November 1918 with
          victory for Britain and its allies.

          {'\n'}
          In 1913, the British government promised 'Home Rule' for Ireland.
          The proposal was to have a self-governing Ireland with its own
          parliament but still part of the UK. A Home Rule Bill was introduced
          in Parliament. It was opposed by the Protestants in the north of
          Ireland, who threatened to resist Home Rule by force.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          The outbreak of the First World War led the British government to
          postpone any changes in Ireland. Irish Nationalists were not willing
          to wait and in 1916 there was an uprising (the Easter Rising) against
          the British in Dublin. The leaders of the uprising were executed under
          military law. A guerrilla war against the British army and the police
          in Ireland followed. In 1921 a peace treaty was signed and in 1922
          Ireland became two countries. The six counties in the north which were
          mainly Protestant remained part of the UK under the name Northern
          Ireland. The rest of Ireland became the Irish Free State. It had its
          own government and became a republic in 1949.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          There were people in both parts of Ireland who disagreed with the
          split between the North and the South. They still wanted Ireland to be
          one independent country. Years of disagreement led to a terror
          campaign in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The conflict between those
          wishing for full Irish independence and those wishing to remain loyal
          to the British government is often referred to as 'the Troubles'.

          {'\n'}In the 1920s, many people's living conditions got better.
          There were improvements in public housing and new homes were built in
          many towns and cities. However, in 1929, the world entered the
          'Great Depression' and some parts of the UK suffered mass
          unemployment. The effects of the depression of the 1930s were felt
          differently in different parts of the UK. The traditional heavy
          industries such as shipbuilding were badly affected but new industries
         , including the automobile and aviation industries, developed. As
          prices generally fell, those in work had more money to spend. Car
          ownership doubled from 1 million to 2 million between 1930 and 1939.
          In addition, many new houses were built. It was also a time of
          cultural blossoming, with writers such as Graham Greene and Evelyn
          Waugh prominent. The economist John Maynard Keynes published
          influential new theories of economics. The BBC started radio
          broadcasts in 1922 and began the world's first regular television
          service in 1936.

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. He believed that
          the conditions imposed on Germany by the Allies after the First World
          War were unfair; he also wanted to conquer more land for the German
          people. He set about renegotiating treaties, building up arms, and
          testing Germany's military strength in nearby countries. The British
          government tried to avoid another war. However, when Hitler invaded
          Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war in order to stop his
          aggression.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          The war was initially fought between the Axis powers (fascist Germany
          and Italy and the Empire of Japan) and the Allies. The main countries
          on the allied side were the UK, France, Poland, Australia, New
          Zealand, Canada, and the Union of South Africa.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          Having occupied Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, Hitler followed
          his invasion of Poland by taking control of Belgium and the
          Netherlands. Then, in 1940, German forces defeated allied troops and
          advanced through France. At this time of national crisis, Winston
          Churchill became Prime Minister and Britain's war leader.

          As France fell, the British decided to evacuate British and French
          soldiers from France in a huge naval operation. Many civilian
          volunteers in small pleasure and fishing boats from Britain helped the
          Navy to rescue more than 300,000 men from the beaches around Dunkirk.
          Although many lives and a lot of equipment were lost, the evacuation
          was a success and meant that Britain was better able to continue the
          fight against the Germans. The evacuation gave rise to the phrase
          'the Dunkirk spirit'.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          From the end of June 1940 until the German invasion of the Soviet
          Union in June 1941, Britain and the Empire stood almost alone against
          Nazi Germany.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          Hitler wanted to invade Britain, but before sending in troops, Germany
          needed to control the air. The Germans waged an air campaign against
          Britain, but the British resisted with their fighter planes and
          eventually won the crucial aerial battle against the Germans, called
          'the Battle of Britain', in the summer of 1940. The most important
          planes used by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain were the
          Spitfire and the Hurricane, which were designed and built in
          Britain. Despite this crucial victory, the German air force was able
          to continue bombing London and other British cities at night-time.
          This was called the Blitz. Coventry was almost totally destroyed and a
          great deal of damage was done in other cities, especially in the East
          End of London. Despite the destruction, there was a strong national
          spirit of resistance in the UK. The phrase 'the Blitz spirit' is
          still used today to describe Britons pulling together in the face of
          adversity.

          Churchill was the son of a politician and, before becoming a
          Conservative MP in 1900, was a soldier and journalist. In May 1940 he
          became Prime Minister. He refused to surrender to the Nazis and was an
          inspirational leader to the British people in a time of great
          hardship. He lost the General Election in 1945 but returned as Prime
          Minister in 1951.

          He was an MP until he stood down at the 1964 General Election.
          Following his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral. He remains
          a much-admired figure to this day, and in 2002 was voted the greatest
          Briton of all time by the public. During the War, he made many famous
          speeches including lines which you may still hear:

          At the same time as defending Britain, the British military was
          fighting the Axis on many other fronts. In Singapore, the Japanese
          defeated the British and then occupied Burma, threatening India. The
          United States entered the war when the Japanese bombed its naval base
          at Pearl Harbour in December 1941.

          That same year, Hitler attempted the largest invasion in history by
          attacking the Soviet Union. It was a fierce conflict, with huge losses
          on both sides. German forces were ultimately repelled by the Soviets,
          and the damage they sustained proved to be a pivotal point in the war.

          The allied forces gradually gained the upper hand, winning significant
          victories in North Africa and Italy. German losses in the Soviet
          Union, combined with the support of the Americans, meant that the
          Allies were eventually strong enough to attack Hitler's forces in
          Western Europe. On 6 June 1944, allied forces landed in Normandy (this
          event is often referred to as 'D-Day'). Following victory on the
          beaches of Normandy, the allied forces pressed on through France and
          eventually into Germany. The Allies comprehensively defeated Germany
          in May 1945.

          at Manchester and then Cambridge University, were the first to
