          Constitutional monarchy - The Bill of Rights
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}
          At the coronation of William and Mary, a Declaration of Rights was
          read. This confirmed that the king would no longer be able to raise
          taxes or administer justice without agreement from Parliament. The
          balance of power between monarch and Parliament had now permanently
          changed. The Bill of Rights, 1689, confirmed the rights of Parliament
          and the limits of the king's power. Parliament took control of who
          could be monarch and declared that the king or queen must be a
          Protestant. A new Parliament had to be elected at least every three
          years (later this became seven years and now it is five years). Every
          year the monarch had to ask Parliament to renew funding for the army
          and the navy.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          These changes meant that, to be able to govern effectively, the
          monarch needed to have advisers, or ministers, who would be able to
          ensure a majority of votes in the House of Commons and the House of
          Lords. There were two main groups in Parliament, known as the Whigs
          and the Tories. (The modern Conservative Party is still sometimes
          referred to as the Tories.) This was the beginning of party politics.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          This was also an important time for the development of a free press
          (newspapers and other publications which are not controlled by the
          government). From 1695, newspapers were allowed to operate without a
          government licence. Increasing numbers of newspapers began to be
          published.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          The laws passed after the Glorious Revolution are the beginning of
          what is called 'constitutional monarchy'. The monarch remained
          very important but was no longer able to insist on particular policies
          or actions if Parliament did not agree. After William III, the
          ministers gradually became more important than the monarch but this
          was not a democracy in the modern sense. The number of people who had
          the right to vote for members of Parliament was still very small. Only
          men who owned property of a certain value were able to vote. No women
          at all had the vote. Some constituencies were controlled by a single
          wealthy family. These were called 'pocket boroughs'. Other
          constituencies had hardly any voters and were called 'rotten
          boroughs'.

          This was a time when many people left Britain and Ireland to settle in
          new colonies in America and elsewhere, but others came to live in
          Britain. The first Jews to come to Britain since the Middle Ages
          settled in London in 1656. Between 1680 and 1720 many refugees called
          Huguenots came from France. They were Protestants and had been
          persecuted for their religion. Many were educated and skilled and
          worked as scientists, in banking, or in weaving or other crafts.

          William and Mary's successor, Queen Anne, had no surviving children.
          This created uncertainty over the succession in England, Wales and
          Ireland and in Scotland. The Act of Union, known as the Treaty of
          Union in Scotland, was therefore agreed in 1707, creating the Kingdom
          of Great Britain. Although Scotland was no longer an independent
          country, it kept its own legal and education systems and Presbyterian
          Church. {'\n'}

          {'\n'}
          When Queen Anne died in 1714, Parliament chose a German, George I, to
          be the next king, because he was Anne's nearest Protestant relative.
          An attempt by Scottish Jacobites to put James II's son on the throne
          instead was quickly defeated. George I did not speak very good English
          and this increased his need to rely on his ministers. The most
          important minister in Parliament became known as the Prime Minister.
          The first man to be called this was Sir Robert Walpole, who was Prime
          Minister from 1721 to 1742. {'\n'}

          {'\n'}In 1745 there was another attempt to put a Stuart king back on
          the throne in place of George I's son, George II. Charles Edward
          Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), the grandson of James II, landed in
          Scotland. He was supported by clansmen from the Scottish highlands and
          raised an army. Charles initially had some successes but was defeated
          by George II's army at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Charles
          escaped back to Europe.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}The clans lost a lot of their power and influence after
          Culloden. Chieftains became landlords if they had the favour of the
          English king, and clansmen became tenants who had to pay for the land
          they used.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}A process began which became known as the 'Highland
          Clearances'. Many Scottish landlords destroyed individual small
          farms (known as 'crofts') to make space for large flocks of sheep
          and cattle. Evictions became very common in the early 19th century.
          Many Scottish people left for North America at this time.

          {'\n'}
          During the 18th century, new ideas about politics, philosophy and
          science were developed. This is often called 'the Enlightenment'.
          Many of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment were Scottish. Adam
          Smith developed ideas about economics which are still referred to
          today. David Hume's ideas about human nature continue to influence
          philosophers. Scientific discoveries, such as James Watt's work on
          steam power, helped the progress of the Industrial Revolution. One of
          the most important principles of the Enlightenment was that everyone
          should have the right to their own political and religious beliefs and
          that the state should not try to dictate to them. This continues to be
          an important principle in the UK today.

          Before the 18th century, agriculture was the biggest source of
          employment in Britain. There were many cottage industries, where
          people worked from home to produce goods such as cloth and lace.

          The Industrial Revolution was the rapid development of industry in
          Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries. Britain was the first country
          to industrialise on a large scale. It happened because of the
          development of machinery and the use of steam power. Agriculture and
          the manufacturing of goods became mechanised. This made things more
          efficient and increased production. Coal and other raw materials were
          needed to power the new factories. Many people moved from the
          countryside and started working in the mining and manufacturing
          industries.

          The development of the Bessemer process for the mass production of

          {'\n'}Born in 1732, Arkwright originally trained and worked as a
          barber. He was able to dye hair and make wigs. When wigs became less
          popular, he started to work in textiles. He improved the original
          carding machine. Carding is the process of preparing fibres for
          spinning into yarn and fabric. He also developed horse-driven spinning
          mills that used only one machine. This increased the efficiency of
          production. Later, he used the steam engine to power machinery.
          Arkwright is particularly remembered for the efficient and profitable
          way that he ran his factories.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          Better transport links were needed to transport raw materials and
          manufactured goods. Canals were built to link the factories to towns
          and cities and to the ports, particularly in the new industrial areas
          in the middle and north of England.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          Working conditions during the Industrial Revolution were very poor.
          There were no laws to protect employees, who were often forced to work
          long hours in dangerous situations. Children also worked and were
          treated in the same way as adults. Sometimes they were treated even
          more harshly.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          This was also a time of increased colonisation overseas. Captain James
          Cook mapped the coast of Australia and a few colonies were established
          there. Britain gained control over Canada, and the East India Company,
          originally set up to trade, gained control of large parts of India.
          Colonies began to be established in southern Africa.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          Britain traded all over the world and began to import more goods.
          Sugar and tobacco came from North America and the West Indies;
          textiles, tea and spices came from India and the area that is today
          called Indonesia. Trading and settlements overseas sometimes brought
          Britain into conflict with other countries, particularly France, which
          was expanding and trading in a similar way in many of the same areas
          of the world.

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}
          This commercial expansion and prosperity was sustained in part by the
          booming slave trade. While slavery was illegal within Britain itself,
          by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry,
          dominated by Britain and the American colonies. Slaves came primarily
          from West Africa. Travelling on British ships in horrible conditions,
          they were taken to America and the Caribbean, where they were made to
          work on tobacco and sugar plantations. The living and working
          conditions for slaves were very bad. Many slaves tried to escape and
          others revolted against their owners in protest at their terrible
          treatment.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          There were, however, people in Britain who opposed the slave trade.
          The first formal anti-slavery groups were set up by the Quakers in the
          late 1700s, and they petitioned Parliament to ban the practice.
          William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian and a member of
          Parliament, also played an important part in changing the law. Along
          with other abolitionists (people who supported the abolition of
          slavery), he succeeded in turning public opinion against the slave
          trade. In 1807, it became illegal to trade slaves in British ships or
          from British ports, and in 1833 the Emancipation Act abolished slavery
          throughout the British Empire. The Royal Navy stopped slave ships from
          other countries, freed the slaves and punished the slave traders.
          After 1833, 2 million Indian and Chinese workers were employed to
          replace the freed slaves. They worked on sugar plantations in the
          Caribbean, in mines in South Africa, on railways in East Africa and in
          the army in Kenya. {'\n'}

          By the 1760s, there were substantial British colonies in North

          affairs. Many of the colonist families had originally gone to North
          America in order to have religious freedom. They were well educated
          and interested in ideas of liberty. The British government wanted to
          tax the colonies. The colonists saw this as an attack on their freedom
          and said there should be 'no taxation without representation' in
          the British Parliament. Parliament tried to compromise by repealing
          some of the taxes, but relationships between the British government
          and the colonies continued to worsen. Fighting broke out between the
          colonists and the British forces. In 1776, 13 American colonies
          declared their independence, stating that people had a right to
          establish their own governments. The colonists eventually defeated the

          French and Spanish fleets, winning the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
          Admiral Nelson was in charge of the British fleet at Trafalgar and was
          killed in the battle. Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London,
          is a monument to him. His ship, HMS Victory, can be visited in
          Portsmouth. The British army also fought against the French. In 1815,

          Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. Wellington was known as

          of 1800. This created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
          One symbol of this union between England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland

          reforms helped the development of British industry, because raw
          materials could now be imported more cheaply.

          in London to the south west of England, the West Midlands and Wales.
          Many of Brunel's bridges are still in use today.

          British industry led the world in the 19th century. The UK produced
          more than half of the world's iron, coal and cotton cloth. The UK
          also became a centre for financial services, including insurance and
          banking. In 1851, the Great Exhibition opened in Hyde Park in the
          Crystal Palace, a huge building made of steel and glass. Exhibits
          ranged from huge machines to handmade goods. Countries from all over
          the world showed their goods but most of the objects were made in
          Britain.

          {'\n'}From 1853 to 1856, Britain fought with Turkey and France against
          Russia in the Crimean War. It was the first war to be extensively
          covered by the media through news stories and photographs. The
          conditions were very poor and many soldiers died from illnesses they
          caught in the hospitals, rather than from war wounds. Queen Victoria
          introduced the Victoria Cross medal during this war. It honours acts
          of valour by soldiers.

          {'\n'}Florence Nightingale was born in Italy to English parents. At
          the age of 31, she trained as a nurse in Germany. In 1854, she went to
          Turkey and worked in military hospitals, treating soldiers who were
          fighting in the Crimean War. She and her fellow nurses improved the
          conditions in the hospital and reduced the mortality rate. In 1860 she
          established the Nightingale Training School for nurses at St Thomas'
          Hospital in London. The school was the first of its kind and still
          exists today, as do many of the practices that Florence used. She is
          often regarded as the founder of modern nursing.

        <Text style={styles.title}>Ireland in the 19th century</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}Conditions in Ireland were not as good as in the rest of the UK.
          Two-thirds of the population still depended on farming to make their
          living, often on very small plots of land. Many depended on potatoes
          as a large part of their diet. In the middle of the century the potato
          crop failed, and Ireland suffered a famine. A million people died from
          disease and starvation. Another million and a half left Ireland. Some
          emigrated to the United States and others came to England. By 1861
          there were large populations of Irish people in cities such as
          Liverpool, London, Manchester and Glasgow.
          {'\n'} {'\n'}
          The Irish Nationalist movement had grown strongly through the 19th
          century. Some, such as the Fenians, favoured complete independence.
          Others, such as Charles Stuart Parnell, advocated 'Home Rule', in
          which Ireland would remain in the UK but have its own parliament.

        <Text style={styles.title}>The right to vote</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}As the middle classes in the wealthy industrial towns and cities
          grew in influence, they began to demand more political power. The
          Reform Act of 1832 had greatly increased the number of people with the
          right to vote. The Act also abolished the old pocket and rotten
          boroughs (see Chapter 4) and more parliamentary seats were given to
          the towns and cities. There was a permanent shift of political power
          from the countryside to the towns but voting was still based on
          ownership of property. This meant that members of the working class
          were still unable to vote.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}A movement began to demand the vote for the working classes and
          other people without property. Campaigners, called the Chartists,
          presented petitions to Parliament. At first they seemed to be
          unsuccessful, but in 1867 there was another Reform Act. This created
          many more urban seats in Parliament and reduced the amount of property
          that people needed to have before they could vote. However, the
          majority of men still did not have the right to vote and no women
          could vote.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          Politicians realised that the increased number of voters meant that
          they needed to persuade people to vote for them if they were to be
          sure of being elected to Parliament. The political parties began to
          create organisations to reach out to ordinary voters. Universal
          suffrage (the right of every adult, male or female, to vote) followed
          in the next century.

          {'\n'}
          In common with the rest of Europe, women in 19th century Britain had
          fewer rights than men. Until 1870, when a woman got married, her
          earnings, property and money automatically belonged to her husband.
          Acts of Parliament in 1870 and 1882 gave wives the right to keep their
          own earnings and property. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
          an increasing number of women campaigned and demonstrated for greater
          rights and, in particular, the right to vote. They formed the
          women's suffrage movement and became known as 'suffragettes'.

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}Emmeline Pankhurst was born in Manchester in 1858. She set up
          the Women's Franchise League in 1889, which fought to get the vote
          in local elections for married women. In 1903 she helped found the
          Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). This was the first group
          whose members were called 'suffragettes'. The group used civil
          disobedience as part of their protest to gain the vote for women. They
          chained themselves to railings, smashed windows and committed arson.
          Many of the women, including Emmeline, went on hunger strike. In 1918,
          women over the age of 30 were given voting rights and the right to
          stand for Parliament, partly in recognition of the contribution women
          made to the war effort during the First World War. Shortly before
          Emmeline's death in 1928, women were given the right to vote at the
          age of 21, the same as men.{'\n'}

        <Text style={styles.title}>The future of the Empire</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          {'\n'}Although the British Empire continued to grow until the 1920s,
          there was already discussion in the late 19th century about its future
          direction. Supporters of expansion believed that the Empire benefited
          Britain through increased trade and commerce. Others thought the
          Empire had become over-expanded and that the frequent conflicts in
          many parts of the Empire, such as India's north-west frontier or
          southern Africa, were a drain on resources. Yet the great majority of
          British people believed in the Empire as a force for good in the
          world.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 made the discussions about the future of
          the Empire more urgent. The British went to war in South Africa with
          settlers from the Netherlands called the Boers. The Boers fought
          fiercely and the war went on for over three years. Many died in the
          fighting and many more from disease. There was some public sympathy
          for the Boers and people began to question whether the Empire could
          continue. As different parts of the Empire developed, they won greater
          freedom and autonomy from Britain. Eventually, by the second half of
          the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition
          from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their
          independence.
