          {'\n'}Music is an important part of British culture, with a rich and
          varied heritage. It ranges from classical music to modern pop. There
          are many different venues and musical events that take place across
          the UK.

          The Proms is an eight-week summer season of orchestral classical music
          that takes place in various venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in
          London. It has been organised by the British Broadcasting Corporation
          (BBC) since 1927. The Last Night of the Proms is the most well-known
          concert and (along with others in the series) is broadcast on
          television.

          Classical music has been popular in the UK for many centuries. Henry
          Purcell (1659 - 95) was the organist at Westminster Abbey. He wrote
          church music, operas and other pieces, and developed a British style
          distinct from that elsewhere in Europe. He continues to be influential
          on British composers.{'\n'}

          The German-born composer George Frederick Handel (1695 - 1759) spent
          many years in the UK and became a British citizen in 1727. He wrote
          the Water Music for King George I and Music for the Royal Fireworks
          for his son, George II. Both these pieces continue to be very popular.
          Handel also wrote an oratorio, Messiah, which is sung regularly by
          choirs, often at Easter time.

          More recently, important composers include Gustav Holst (1874 - 1934),
          whose work includes The Planets, a suite of pieces themed around the
          planets of the solar system. He adapted Jupiter, part of the Planets
          suite, as the tune for I vow to thee my country, a popular hymn in
          British churches.

          Other types of popular music, including folk music, jazz, pop and
          music, have flourished in Britain since the 20th century. Britain has
          had an impact on popular music around the world, due to the wide use
          of the English language, the UK's cultural links with many countries,
          and British capacity for invention and innovation. Since the 1960s,
          British pop music has made one of the most important cultural
          contributions to life in the UK. Bands including The Beatles and The
          Rolling Stones continue to have an influence on music both here and
          abroad. British pop music has continued to innovate - for example, the
          Punk movement of the late 1970s, and the trend towards boy and girl
          bands in the 1990s.

          There are many large venues that host music events throughout the

          There are theatres in most towns and cities throughout the UK, ranging
          from the large to the small. They are an important part of local
          communities and often show both professional and amateur productions.
          London's West End, also known as 'Theatreland', is particularly well
          known. The Mousetrap, a murder-mystery play by Dame Agatha Christie,
          has been running in the West End since 1952 and has had the longest
          initial run of any show in history.

          There is also a strong tradition of musical theatre in the UK. In the
          19th century, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote comic operas, often making
          fun of popular culture and politics. These operas include HMS
          Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. Gilbert and
          Sullivan's work is still often staged by professional and amateur
          groups. More recently, Andrew Lloyd Webber has written the music for
          shows which have been popular throughout the world, including, in
          collaboration with Tim Rice, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and
          also Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.

          One British tradition is the pantomime. Many theatres produce a
          pantomime at Christmas time. They are based on fairy stories and are
          light-hearted plays with music and comedy, enjoyed by family
          audiences. One of the traditional characters is the Dame, a woman
          played by a man. There is often also a pantomime horse or cow played
          by two actors in the same costume.

          During the Middle Ages, most art had a religious theme, particularly
          wall paintings in churches and illustrations in religious books. Much
          of this was lost after the Protestant Reformation but wealthy families
          began to collect other paintings and sculptures. Many of the painters
          working in Britain in the 16th and 17th centuries were from abroad -
          for example, Hans Holbein and Sir Anthony Van Dyck. British artists,
          particularly those painting portraits and landscapes, became well
          known from the 18th century onwards.

          Works by British and international artists are displayed in galleries

          The architectural heritage of the UK is rich and varied. In the Middle
          Ages, great cathedrals and churches were built, many of which still
          stand today. Examples are the cathedrals in Durham, Lincoln,
          Canterbury and Salisbury. The White Tower in the Tower of London is an
          example of a Norman castle keep, built on the orders of William the
          Conqueror.

          {'\n'}Gradually, as the countryside became more peaceful and
          landowners became richer, the houses of the wealthy became more
          elaborate and great country houses such as Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire
          were built. British styles of architecture began to evolve.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          In the 17th century, Inigo Jones took inspiration from classical
          architecture to design the Queen's House at Greenwich and the
          Banqueting House in Whitehall in London. Later in the century, Sir
          Christopher Wren helped develop a British version of the ornate styles
          popular in Europe in buildings such as the new St Paul's Cathedral.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          In the 18th century, simpler designs became popular. The Scottish
          architect Robert Adam influenced the development of architecture in
          the UK, Europe and America. He designed the inside decoration as well
          as the building itself in great houses such as Dumfries House in
          Scotland. His ideas influenced architects in cities such as Bath,
          where the Royal Crescent was built.
          {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          In the 19th century, the medieval 'gothic' style became popular again.
          As cities expanded, many great public buildings were built in this
          style. The Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station were built at
          this time, as were the town halls in cities such as Manchester and
          Sheffield.

          government in India. After the First World War, he was responsible for
          many war memorials throughout the world, including the Cenotaph in
          Whitehall. The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Remembrance Day
          service attended by the Queen, politicians and foreign ambassadors.

          Alongside the development of architecture, garden design and
          landscaping have played an important role in the UK. In the 18th
          century, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown designed the grounds around
          country houses so that the landscape appeared to be natural, with
          grass, trees and lakes. He often said that a place had 'capabilities'.
          Later, Gertrude Jekyll often worked with Edwin Lutyens to design
          colourful gardens around the houses he designed. Gardens continue to
          be an important part of homes in the UK. The annual Chelsea Flower
          Show showcases garden design from Britain and around the world.

          Beowulf tells of its hero's battles against monsters and is still
          translated into modern English. Poems which survive from the Middle
          Ages include Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and a poem called Sir Gawain
          and the Green Knight, about one of the knights at the court of King
          Arthur.

          As well as plays, Shakespeare wrote many sonnets (poems which must be
          14 lines long) and some longer poems. As Protestant ideas spread, a
          number of poets wrote poems inspired by their religious views. One of
          these was John Milton, who wrote Paradise Lost.

          Other poets, including William Wordsworth, were inspired by nature.
          Sir Walter Scott wrote poems inspired by Scotland and the traditional
          stories and songs from the area on the borders of Scotland and
          England. He also wrote novels, many of which were set in Scotland.

          Poetry was very popular in the 19th century, with poets such as
          William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Alfred Lord
          Tennyson, and Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Later, many poets - for
          example, Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon - were inspired to write
          about their experiences in the First World War. More recently, popular
          poets have included Sir Walter de la Mare, John Masefield, Sir John
          Betjeman and Ted Hughes. Some of the best-known poets are buried or
          commemorated in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey.
